        "* Option 2 can be risky if we are not careful. By considering \"Comedy\" as a subclass of \"Movie\" we imply that every entity that is an instance of \"Comedy\" is also an instance of \"Movie\". That is only correct if instead of \"Comedy\" we call the subclass \"ComedyMovie\". But then that limits the use of genres only to movies. Moreover, with option 2, the knowledge about genres becomes implicit. If we also want to support a question like \"What are the all movie genres\" we cannot do it, unless all movie subclasses are only genres.\n",
